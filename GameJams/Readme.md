## 7 Killer Tips for Making a Game in 48 Hours
http://www.acagamic.com/work/events/7-killer-tips-for-making-a-game-in-48-hours/

- **Never Fall in Love.** The second theorem of destruction says “as love and effort increase, the probability of self-destruction approaches 1”. Maintain a healthy distance to your game and do not be afraid to fail spectacularly.
- **Harmony.** Visuals, music, movement. Think economically: Less time means less assets means focus on harmony of what you have.
- **Shh...** Audio is half the game experience.
- **Make The Toy First.** Try out your game mechanic first. Once you are convinced that this is fun to play, you can flesh out the game.
- **Feel Something.** Art games create feelings in the player, they have subtext and theme. If you lack the craftsmanship, at least give your game an artistic name.
- **Create a Low Barrier of Entry.** A game must be fun within the first 15 seconds. If you are one of the cool kids, you include title and instruction screens in the game (as for example Braid).
- **Adjust Expectations.** Introduce only ONE new concept to the world of gaming as fast and as clear as you possibly can.
