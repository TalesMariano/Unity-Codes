About ReplaceTextForTextMeshPro.cs
> hi. the script wasn't working with current Unity & TMPro.. so i updated.. i created also a version to convert just the selected GameObject's Text (and not ALL in scene)
> i moved the commands under Tools and renamed them by clarity
> 
> i think some tool like this should go into standard TMPro distribution
> 
> please note that you have to manually substitute the original font ("Arial" in my case) and the destination TMPro font ("Fonts/Arial Latin SDF") which should be in Resources/
